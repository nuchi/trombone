      <h2>How to use it</h2>
      <div id="content-wrapper">
        <p>Click and drag in the image above to control the simulated trombone. The horizontal axis controls embouchure. Move to the right for higher pitch, left for lower pitch. The vertical axis controls slide length: move down to retract the slide, up to extend. The diagonal lines indicate resonances, where the embouchure and the slide length sync up to generate a clean tone (the ones in red are the ones that are out of tune when the slide is fully retracted). I've also added vertical dashed lines at Bb (thick) and F (thin) as rough guides. You can lip up and down to bend notes. The fat diagonal line all the way on the left is the pedal tone.</p>
        <p>If you're using a device with a keyboard, you can also hold the "f" key for flutter tongue, and hold the "g" key to growl into the trombone.</p>
        <!-- <h2>How it works</h2>
        <p>This is a physically modeled trombone. The lips are modeled by a damped spring controlling a valve between constant lung pressure entering a tube open on the other end. The embouchure control directly modifies the spring constant. The slide length control modifies the length of the tube. The flared bell is modeled by a  -->
